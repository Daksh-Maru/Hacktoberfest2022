# Rules To Follow while sending pull request:

- Please adhere to the file structure provided, i.e. place your code only in the appropriate folders. For example, if you want to add a data structure in C++, put it in the appropriate folder. If you prefer another language, create a new folder (if one does not already exist) and use the same file structure.
- Do not disburse spam codes (They should be proper codes and not just one liners or space fixes).
- Please try to include detailed descriptions of the code you're adding.
- Single-line commits will be rejected and marked as spam.
- For DSA Code: Try to add time and space complexity to the actual code as comments.
- Follow the pull request template
